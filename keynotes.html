They have recently seen a rapid increase of popularity due to their flexible-yet-scalable design and robustness against intrusion. They serve today as a backbone of real-world permission-less payment settlement networks (e.g., Ripple and Stellar) as well as several other weak-identity systems such as spam-resistant communication protocols and Sybil-tolerant social networks. In payment scenarios, due to their unique capability to unite emerging crypto-currencies and user-defined currencies with the traditional fiat currency and banking systems, several existing and new payment enterprises are entering in this space. Nevertheless, this enthusiasm in the market significantly exceeds our understanding of security, privacy, and reliability of these inherently distributed systems. Currently employed ad hoc strategies to fix apparent flaws have made those systems vulnerable to bigger problems once they become lucrative targets for malicious players.

In this talk, we will first define the concept of IOU credit networks, and describe some of the important credit network applications. We will then present and analyze the recent and ongoing projects to improve the credit-network security, privacy and reliability. We will end our discussion with interesting technical as well as legal challenges in the field.</p>

			<p style="text-align:justify">In this talk, we will consider the aspect of deploying SDN or software defined networks from a providers' perspective. SDN has shown promise of making the network programmable and hence agile towards offering new service paradigms that are specifically user-centric. SDN gear has the capability of performing complex network functions by bifurcating an SDN box into a control-plane that is centralized and programmable and a data-plane that can manifest any of the programmable functions with ease. Carrier-class performance requires guarantees in terms of latency, bandwidth support and other QoS measures. We examine what it would take for SDN "white-boxes" to meet carrier-class performance. Specifically, we will study our recently proposed network hardware virtualization concept and examine how it facilitates SDN white-boxes to be made service-centric. We will examine hardware architecture from the perspective of ASICs, FPGAs and network processors and understand the issues that determine data-plane abstraction. Metrics to evaluate such architectures and comparison with conventional products will be discussed. We will conclude by understanding a generic switch model that has been extended to an SDN white-box.</p>
